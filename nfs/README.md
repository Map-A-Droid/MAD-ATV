Magisk module: NFS-Injector

*** Note: this module sometimes causes problems, and krzthehunter wont help you with them ***

For those that might suffer with performance issues with their atv devices, for example, constant crashing, NFS Injector helps manage your ram and provides an overall better experience with performance. It will probably need more testing, but so far there are reports that even a 1gb model was able to scan for quests. 

Not that the previous statment means that you should go and buy a ton of 1 gb models, because it's not recommended at all, some people just get sent the wrong models or have bad ram and this can help out so as your money was not a complete waste. However the device in question wouldn't even load the game properly before but yielded some results with the module installed.

Another example, some 2gb models would freeze up completely and would require the power cord to be pulled out nearly every 10 minutes. Now said device might run for hours or even stop freezing up completely.

Below is the link to the XDA page to get more information which includes instructions on how to change the modes you can use, between Balanced (Default), Gaming and Ultra.

**Do not install via magisk manager**. Install via TWRP. 
Since ROM version 1.1.0 manual instalation of the NFS module is no longer required, instead instalation will run automatically provided you execute the file **/system/bin/nfs_install.sh**

If you choose to manually install the NFS module instead of using the above script:
Visit the above XDA thread and download the zip and flash from recovery.

Congratulations on a slightly more reliable device! (we hope!)

*The /system/bin/nfs_install.sh script contained in the rom was included to reduce the chance of problems, so that is the recomended install method as of version 1.1.0*
