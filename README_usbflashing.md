How to flash a ROM using a USB-A to USB-A cable.

Avoid the $1 cables because you need a data cable, not just a charging cable. People often have problems with longer cables. I got a $5 1.5' cable from [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P0E3954/) and it has been working perfectly for me.

* Get the USB Burning Tool from the links [here](https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD-ATV/wiki#flashing-instructions).
* Run USB Burning too. 
* Click File and then import image.
* Select your rom and then click start (leave the other options alone).
* Plug the USB-A to USB-A cable in to the computer but not the box yet.
* Push in and hold the reset button while plugging the usb cable into your Android TV box. If you do not see the reset button on the outside, it is probably inside/end of the the AV port. Use a non condutive material (such as toothpick for example) to press it. You should feel a click when you press the button at the end of the AV port.
* It will only work on 1 of your boxes USB ports, so if nothing happens try the other one. If that doesnt help try other ports on your computer, or maybe even another computer, or another cable
* When the box is seen in the burn tool it will start flashing. Connect the power cable.
* After 100% you may click stop. Then close the USB burn tool. Then unplug the box.
* Congratulations, you have flashed the ROM!
