How to flash a ROM using a USB-a to USB-a cable.
<br> Avoid the $1 cables because you need a data cable, not just a charging cable. People often have problems with longer cables. I got a $5 cable from [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P0E3954/) and it has been working perfectly for me.

<br> Run USB Burning tool
<br> click File and then import image.
<br> select your rom and then click start (leave the other options alone)
<br> Plug the USB-A to USB-A cable in to the computer but not the box yet
<br> Then push in and hold the reset button while plugging the usb cable into your android box. If you do not see the reset button, it is probably inside the AV port. Use a non condutive material to press it (toothpick for example).
<br> It will only work on 1 of your boxes USB ports, so if nothing happens try the other one. If that doesnt help try other ports on your computer, or maybe even another computer, or another cable
<br> When the box is seen in the burn tool it will start flashing. Connect the power cable.
<br> After 100% you may click stop. Then close the USB burn tool. Then unplug the box. Congratulations, you have flashed the ROM!
