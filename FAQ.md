## Question #1) <br> After I Flash the rom and it installs the apps and then reboots itself, it does not boot to the recovery. Can you help?<br>

* Answer: There are 2 known answers to this:<br>Some users reported their television could not display twrp, and switching to a monitor fixed it for them.<br>Other users needed to find a different recovery that works on their box. Here is a specific example:<br>
<br>[This recovery](https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD-ATV/raw/master/recovery_rare_x96.img) was needed by 2 x96 mini users. They installed the MAD rom and then when it rebooted to recovery nothing loaded. They also could not load the recovery manually by pressing the button inside the AV port while giving it power. This recovery worked for both of them. To use it, format a sd card with fat16 or fat32 and put this file on it named recovery.img and then insert the card into the box without power. While pressing the reset button plug in the power cable and hold down the reset button until the recovery loads. Then continue with Magisk installation.
