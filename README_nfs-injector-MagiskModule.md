####Magisk module: NFS-Injector

For those that might suffer with performance issues with their atv devices, for example, constant crashing, NFS Injector helps manage your ram and provides an overall better experience with performance. It will probably need more testing, but so far there are reports that even a 1gb model was able to scan for quests. 

Not that the previous statment means that you should go and buy a ton of 1 gb models, because it's not recommended at all, some people just get sent the wrong models or have bad ram and this can help out so as your money was not a complete waste. However the device in question wouldn't even load the game properly before but yielded some results with the module installed.

Another example, some 2gb models would freeze up completely and would require the power cord to be pulled out nearly every 10 minutes. Now said device might run for hours or even stop freezing up completely.

Below is the link to the XDA page to get more information which includes instructions on how to change the modes you can use, between Balanced, Gaming and Ultra.

To install:
Load up Magisk Manager.
Open up the side options in the top left corner of the app and choose Downloads.
Find the module NFS-Injector and choose install, wait for it to flash and then choose Reboot.

Congratulations on a slightly more reliable device!

One thing to note is, if you are using scrcpy to install the module, there's a chance that the scrcpy screen might crash with the error "Could not send video packet/ could not process frame. This is fine and won't mess anything up with installing, it just means you can't see it happening without reloading scrcpy.
